You are given three text files named mon.txt, tue.txt and wed.txt. Each file
contains 1 URL per line, something like

http://www.foofoofoo.com?embedCode=abc?foo=bar...
http://www.foofoofoo.com
http://www.foofoofoo.com?foo=bar2&embedCode=uwk?blah=blah

Write a program to extract the value for embedCode and report unique values.
You can assume the size of each file to be 100M and we have enough memory. You
have 12 minutes to finish this code.
